This program is very simple to write in many programming languages, and is often used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. \"Hello, World!\" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,[1] and they can also be used as a sanity test to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.\n"

Like all assembly languages, it uses short mnemonics to represent the fundamental instructions that the CPU in a computer can understand and follow.[3] Compilers sometimes produce assembly code as an intermediate step when translating a high level program into machine code.  Regarded as a programming language, assembly coding is machine-specific and low level. Assembly languages are more typically used for detailed and time critical applications such as small real-time embedded systems or operating system kernels and device drivers.\n"
